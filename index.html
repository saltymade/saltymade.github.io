        <p>During the winter I went skiing. Yayayay!<br>
        I skied with my sister at different ski resorts. <br>
        It was a lot of fun and I did my first double black<br>
        I also did a little snowboarding and got better at it.<br>
        Overall it was a really great winter with a lot of skiing

        <p>My mom, sister, and I traveled to the big Island in Hawaii.<br>
        There we were able to snorkel, swim, and relax. We had <br>
        a lot of fun. We ate really good and fresh food there.<br>
        Also, we saw a big shark as well as dolphins, turtles, and<br> and Octopus.Sadly we didn't have a car to explore the island,<br>
        but it was still a lot of fun.
